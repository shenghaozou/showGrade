You didn't get full credits because of data cleaning challenge.

Think about what kind of dirty data we should process:

e.g. "David Page"

dirty data can be:
" David Page"
"David  Page"
"david page"
" David   PAGE    "

You can use:
1. .strip() to clean the extra spaces at the beginning and the end.
2. replace("  ", " ") (make sure you can process the data such as "David     Page") to clean the extra spaces
3. .lower() / .upper() to unify the case.

You can also think about other solutions.
