One solution to encode string function is:
# 1. create a temp empty string
temp = ""
for c in original_string:
    if c is special (e.g. A):
        temp += the special character (e.g. @)
    else: # c is not special
        temp += c

Code above is not the real code but that's very close. Think about how to use this template to code this function.
